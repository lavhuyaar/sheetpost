### Personal thoughts:

If you're coming from the backend or admin panel repo, did you noticed that the README is very similar? That is because this README has been copied and modified from that README only, and I've done this copy-pasta thing with the Pages, UI, Components, functionality as well. This is why the main website took way lesser time to complete than Admin Panel.

The color palette from this website is wayyyy better than the Admin panel (intentionally did that). I liked it, although a user can not do much other than commenting, but hey, this was supposed to be a simple functioning website, and I was successful in making one, so I'm happy :)

The deployment went super smooth. This was my first website where I had separate frontend and backend and I loved it.

Keep up the good work Lav (03-05-2025)
